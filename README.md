# taptaghtml
This is the taptag website that I have created for my internship. I started creating my idea through html/css/javascript so I can easily move onto React.js. As I am not familiar with using git right now, I only uploaded the last version of my website. Also, there are some issues with my website right now, where the download button does not work on the image slider and one of the popup menus do not work. I decided to fix those issues through react.js. It took me around 2-3 weeks to finish this website as it was the first time for me to create a website. First, I decided to put all information in a box, but later realized there are unnecessary information and the website looked boring. Therefore, I decided to switch the first 3 part of the website to be more diverse looking and have more interaction with the user. 

Additionaly,
This html should be open through hello.js, which is a express server file to open the html. Without the server, the html cannot get the files from css and javascript and would be just a normal html.
